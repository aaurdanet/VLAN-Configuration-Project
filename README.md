Cisco VLAN Configuration Project Overview

This project extends configuring VLANs in a Cisco environment. The focus is on the addition of another VLAN, requiring a unique address space for each VLAN. A router is introduced to facilitate unique addressing spaces for each VLAN. The project demonstrates how VLANs are utilized to create multiple unique networks on a single networking hardware device, following the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard ethernet frame and the IEEE 802.1Q standard for VLAN tagging.
